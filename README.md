## Minimc
![Test Image 3](Assets/banner.png)

Minimc is a playable **MMO minecraft** 'clone' in Discord.
<br>You can **generate unique worlds**, **invite your friends** to them and play together.

The game features various logic like handling **physics**, **tick rate**, **collisions**, **block states** and even really good looking **2D Lighting calculations**.
<br>This new version includes **image generation** which eliminated certain limitations I ran into previously. (Old version used a conversion from data to emojis for rendering the world)

## How to contribute
Modify the [your.env](.env) with your required credentials. 

Rename `your.env` to `.env`

Create your database (example: [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/de/)) with the correct name from [.env](.env)

Depending on your [DBMS](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos-basic-skills?topic=zos-what-is-database-management-system) you maybe have to modify the [database.py](database.py) due to different connectors.

MySQL
```py
 engine = create_engine(f"mysql+mysqlconnector://{user}:{pwd}@{host}/{database}")
 ```

MariaDB
```py
 engine = create_engine(f"mysql+pymysql://{user}:{pwd}@{host}/{database}")
 ```

Install the required libraries from [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
You should now be able to generate a world with the slash command `/generate`
