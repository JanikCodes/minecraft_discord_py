## Mini multiplayer playable minecraft in discord<br>
This project is a mini version of minecraft/terraria featuring a `procedural generated world` with the ability to invite friends to play in your world.
Each `world` kind of acts like a server, so once you invite a friend to play in your `world` they can modify it and move around even while you're offline.
