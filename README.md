# Todo
## Block States
`Blocks` should be representable by states. A `block` can be rendered differently based on those states:
1. `active`
2. `facing_direction`

create a new `block_state` table with a reference to a `block`, an `image`representing the state and when the block is `active` or `facing_direction`.
